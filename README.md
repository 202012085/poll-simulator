# poll-simulator
The objective of this lab is to appreciate factoring for “multi-tier application architecture”. As a hands on small exercise, it lets you attempt implementing a web based “Poll Simulator”
Although I have implemented it through c++ which is terminal based.
but it will always work as good as GUI because I've implemented switch cases.
You have to enter a choice to do the operation which is given in the list and then enter  candidate name in order to let people vote him or her. While voting your vote will be counted but who voted whom will not be saved anywhere. But which candidate recieved how many number of votes would be saved and can be viewed in the voting summary when you want to see it.
